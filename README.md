# Rate Limiter â€” README

Simple README for the **distributed sliding-window rate limiter** (Go + Redis).

---

## What this repo contains

- **`internal/ratelimiter`** â€” sliding-window limiter implementation (Lua + Go), tests and benchmark.
- **`main.go`** â€” small demo that uses the limiter and prints allow/reject for a few users.
- **`.env`** â€” Redis config for app & tests.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** â€” Redis + test runner service that runs unit tests & benchmarks.
- **`go.mod`, `go.sum`**

**Goal:** global per-user rate limiting across multiple instances using Redis sorted sets + a Lua script (atomic).
Uses Redis server time to avoid clock skew between instances.

# Build and run services, test output appears in the console
docker compose up --build
